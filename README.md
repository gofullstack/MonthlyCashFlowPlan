Monthly Cash Flow Plan
======================

I've recently been taking an interest in the [Dave Ramsey][1] Total Money Makeover plan. It just makes sense and seems like the easiest way to handle finances. No tricks and no gimmicks. He has some [PDF forms][2] available for download on his website, and they're good too. However, it is a nuisance to have to do it all by pencil, paper and calculator every month. I went on a search to find a decent-looking spreadsheet template, but didn't find anything worthwhile. There were some out there, but they looked crummy. I should mention that if you buy Dave Ramsey's kit, they may be included, but I can't confirm that.

I took it upon myself to create my own Excel spreadsheet (also compatible with [OpenOffice][3] and [NeoOffice][4]) complete with built-in formulas. Its easy enough to customize depending on what categories you need by adding or removing rows. I haven't fully tested the spreadsheet, so let me know if you come across any bugs or incorrect formulas.

It is somewhat self-explanatory, but here's some advice: fill in the *Total Take-Home Household Income* field (E103) first and make sure it's after taxes.
